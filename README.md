# FlutterPS: Senior Flutter Developer Technical Assessment

## Overview

Welcome to the **FlutterPS** technical assessment! This project is designed to evaluate your skills and expertise in Flutter development. Please follow the instructions below to complete the tasks.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
2. **Complete the Tasks:** Implement the features as described in the sections below.
3. **Follow Best Practices:** Ensure that your code follows Flutter development best practices.
4. **Document Your Work:** Add any relevant information, explanations, or assumptions to the `README.md` file.
5. **Submit Your Work:** Once completed, submit your code as per the provided instructions.

## Tasks

### 1. Implement a Custom Widget

- **Task:**  
  Create a custom widget named `GradientCard` with the following features:
  - A gradient background (choose any two colors).
  - Rounded corners.
  - A shadow effect.
  - The widget should accept dynamic content (e.g., text, icons, or buttons) and display it accordingly.

- **Requirements:**  
  Ensure that the widget is reusable and can be easily integrated into different parts of the app. Add an example of the `GradientCard` on the main screen of the app, showcasing its versatility with different content.

- **Objective:**  
  Evaluate your ability to create and reuse custom widgets while adhering to design and usability standards.

### 2. State Management

- **Task:**  
  Implement state management for a to-do list application. The app should:
  - Allow users to add new tasks.
  - Mark tasks as completed.
  - Delete tasks from the list.

- **Requirements:**  
  Use any state management approach you are comfortable with (e.g., Provider, Bloc, or any other). Ensure the state management solution is scalable and follows best practices. Implement a simple UI to interact with the to-do list.

- **Objective:**  
  Assess your understanding of state management in Flutter and your ability to implement it effectively.

### 3. Integrate a REST API

- **Task:**  
  Integrate a REST API to fetch a list of items (e.g., products, posts, or users) and display them in a scrollable list view. Implement the following features:
  - Error handling: Display appropriate messages in case of errors (e.g., network issues).
  - Loading states: Show a loading indicator while the data is being fetched.
  - Pull-to-refresh: Allow users to refresh the data by pulling down on the list.

- **Requirements:**  
  Use any public API of your choice or create a mock API if needed. Display the fetched data in a user-friendly manner, considering pagination if necessary.

- **Objective:**  
  Test your ability to work with APIs, handle asynchronous operations, and manage UI states based on dynamic data.

### 4. Implement Navigation and Routing

- **Task:**  
  Add multiple screens to the application:
  - A Home screen displaying the list of items fetched from the API.
  - A Details screen that shows more information about a selected item from the list.
  - An About screen with static information about the app.

- **Requirements:**  
  Implement navigation between these screens using Flutter’s `Navigator`. Pass data between the Home screen and Details screen to display relevant information. Add a back button to navigate back from the Details screen to the Home screen.

- **Objective:**  
  Evaluate your proficiency with Flutter’s navigation system and your understanding of app architecture.

## Note

Please ensure that you follow Flutter best practices throughout your implementation, including:

- Writing clean and maintainable code.
- Properly structuring your project.
- Efficient state management.
- Clear and consistent UI/UX design.
